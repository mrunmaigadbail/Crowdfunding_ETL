# Crowdfunding_ETL
The Crowdfunding ETL project aims to design and implement an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for a crowdfunding dataset. This dataset contains information about various crowdfunding campaigns, including details about the projects like their creators, the pledged amounts, and the country that their campaign is based in. The primary goal of this project is to create a relational database to store this information and facilitate data retrieval and analysis. By designing an ETL pipeline, we ensure that data from two excel files is extracted, transformed to match our database schema, and loaded into the database seamlessly. Once it is available in the database we can then explore any questions we have about the data by analyzing it.
